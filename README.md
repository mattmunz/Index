# Index

A "top level" introduction to my projects, including an overview and some documentation.

## Objective

I have some hobby projects that I've been working on, sporadically, for a while. While the 
work is in some places quite rough, there may be some ideas there that others might find 
helpful. I'm publishing these projects here, over time. If any of it is of value to you, 
or if you have ideas on how to improve or build on it, please let me know.

## Projects

### Published

None yet.

### Unpublished

All of the following are in various states of incompletion. The names for all of these 
projects are just provisional. Suggestions are welcome :) I'm hoping to start publishing 
some of these soon.
