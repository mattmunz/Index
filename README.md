# index

A "top level" introduction to my projects, including an overview and some documentation.

## Objective

I have some hobby projects that I've been working on, sporadically, for a while. In case anyone might find them useful, I'm publishing them here. If any of this is of value to you, or if you have ideas on how to improve or build on it, please let me know.

## Projects

### Published

None yet.

### Unpublished

All of the following are in various states of incompletion. The names for all of these projects are just provisional. Suggestions are welcome :) I'm hoping to start publishing some of these soon.
